# 0.6.0-alpha
* **BREAKING**: Period/length uses now seconds instead of minutes
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses new syntax to support static
* Support of --debug flag which outputs some dev debug informations
* Support of metrics who are not included in tags api (e.g. autoscaling metrics)

Before
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
      region: eu-west-1
      metrics:
        - name: HealthyHostCount
          statistics:
          - 'Minimum'
          period: 60
          length: 300
```

New Syntax:
```
discovery:
  - region: eu-west-1
    type: elb
    searchTags:
      - Key: KubernetesCluster
        Value: production
    metrics:
      - name: HealthyHostCount
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
static:
  - namespace: AWS/AutoScaling
    region: eu-west-1
    dimensions:
     - name: AutoScalingGroupName
       value: Test
    metrics:
      - name: GroupInServiceInstances
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
```

# 0.5.0
* Support of EFS - Elastic File System
* Support of EBS - Elastic Block Storage

# 0.4.0
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses list as statistics config option,
this should reduce api calls for more than one statistics.

Before:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics: 'Maximum'
```
After:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics:
        - 'Maximum'
```
* Start to track changes in CHANGELOG.md
* Increase speed, not only each jobs threaded but now each metric
* Add s3 support
* Fix potential race condition during cloudwatch access
* Fix bug ignoring period in cloudwatch config
* Use interfaces for aws access and prepare code for unit tests
* Implement minimum, average, maximum, sum for cloudwatch api
* Implement way to handle multiple data returned by cloudwatch
* Update go dependencies
