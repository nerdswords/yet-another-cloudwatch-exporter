* [BREAKING] Fix the calculation of start and end times for GetMetricData (csquire)
```
floating-time-window is now replaced with roundingPeriod

Specifies how the current time is rounded before calculating start/end times for CloudWatch GetMetricData requests. This rounding is optimize performance of the CloudWatch request. This setting only makes sense to use if, for example, you specify a very long period (such as 1 day) but want your times rounded to a shorter time (such as 5 minutes). to For example, a value of 300 will round the current time to the nearest 5 minutes. If not specified, the roundingPeriod defaults to the same value as shortest period in the job.

Thanks a lot to all contributors! - Lovely to see so much efforts especially in testing
to get this project more and more stable. - I know we are far away from a nice tested
code base but we are improving in the right direction and I really love to see all
of your efforts there. It is really appreciated from my side.

I just contacted AWS to get some open source credits so we can build some kind of
end to end tests. This shoud allow us to find tricky bugs earlier and not only when we ship
things.

Love to all of you, Thomas!

# 0.31.0-alpha
* [BREAKING] Decoupled scraping is now default. Removed code which allowed to use scraper without it.
```
# Those flags are just ignored
-decoupled-scraping=false
-decoupled-scraping=true
```
* [BREAKING] Small timeframes of scraping can be used again now. In the past yace decided the scraping
  interval based on config. This magic was removed for simplicity.
```
# In the past this would have in some cases still set --scraping-interval 600
--scraping-interval 10
# Now it really would scrape every 10 seconds which could introduce big API costs. So please watch
# your API requests!
--scraping-interval 10

# 0.29.0-alpha
Okay, private things settled. We have a new organisation for
the project. Lets boost it and get the open PRs merged!
This version is like 0.28.0-alpha but docker images hosted on ghcr.io
and published via new github organisation nerdswords. Find
details [here](https://medium.com/@IT_Supertramp/reorganizing-yace-79d7149b9584).

Thanks to all there waiting and using the product! :)

```

# 0.28.0-alpha
Sorry folks, I currently struggle a little bit
to get things merged fast due to a lot of private
stuff. Really appreciate all your PRs and
hope to get the bigger ones (which are sadly
still not merged yet) into next release.

Really appreciate any person working on this
project! - Have a nice day :)

# 0.16.0-alpha
* Hugh rewrite: Decouple scraping and serving metrics. Thanks so much daviddetorres!
* *BREAKING CHANGE* Decoupled scraping and set scraping interval to 5 minutes.
```
The flag 'decoupled-scraping' makes the exporter to scrape Cloudwatch metrics in background in fixed intervals, in stead of each time that the '/metrics' endpoint is fetched. This protects from the abuse of API requests that can cause extra billing in AWS account. This flag is activated by default.

If the flag 'decoupled-scraping' is activated, the flag 'scraping-interval' defines the seconds between scrapes. Its default value is 300.

* Migrate dependency management to golang modules

# 0.13.0-alpha
* **BREAKING** For some metrics `cloudwatch:ListMetrics` iam permissions are needed. Please update your role!

This should make it easier for new users to have fun with this project.
It fixes for some users `non-histogram and non-summary metrics should not have "_sum" suffix` bug.
```yaml
# Before
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace
      disableTimestamp: true
# After
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace

# Before
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace
# After
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace
      useCloudwatchTimestamp: true

aws_elb_request_count_sum
```

* Add optional delay setting to scraping (Deepak1100)
```yaml

length: 900
delay: 300
```

# 0.10.0
* Reduce usage of listMetrics calls (nhinds)
* Add support of iam roles (nhinds)
* Add optional roleArn setting, which allows scraping with different roles e.g. pull data from mulitple AWS accounts using cross-acount roles (nhinds)
```yaml
    metrics:
      - name: FreeStorageSpace
        roleArn: xxx
        statistics:
        - 'Sum'
        period: 600
        length: 60
```

# 0.9.0
* Add lambda support (nhinds)
* Fix support for listing multiple statistics per metric (nhinds)
* Add tag labels on metrics for easy querying (nhinds)
```
# Before
aws_ec2_cpuutilization_average + on (name) group_left(tag_Name) aws_ec2_info

# After, now name tags are on metrics and no grouping needed
aws_ec2_cpuutilization_average
```

* **BREAKING** Change config syntax. Now you can define tags which are exported as labels on metrics.
Before:

```yaml
discovery:
  - region: eu-west-1
    type: "es"
    searchTags:
      - Key: type
        Value: ^(easteregg|k8s)$
    metrics:
      - name: FreeStorageSpace
        statistics:
        - 'Sum'
        period: 600
        length: 60
```

New Syntax with optional exportedTagsOnMetrics:
```yaml
discovery:
  exportedTagsOnMetrics:
    ec2:
      - Name
  jobs:
    - region: eu-west-1
      type: "es"
      searchTags:
        - Key: type
          Value: ^(easteregg|k8s)$
      metrics:
        - name: FreeStorageSpace
          statistics:
          - 'Sum'
          period: 600
          length: 60
```

# 0.8.0
* Added VPN connection metrics (AndrewChubatiuk)
* Added ExtendedStatistics / percentiles (linefeedse)
* Added Average Statistic (AndrewChubatiuk)

# 0.7.0-alpha
* ALB Support (linefeedse)
* Custom lables for static metrics

Example
```yaml
static:
  - namespace: AWS/AutoScaling
    region: eu-west-1
    dimensions:
     - name: AutoScalingGroupName
       value: Test
    customTags:
      - Key: CustomTag
        Value: CustomValue
    metrics:
      - name: GroupInServiceInstances
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
```

# 0.6.1
* Sanitize colons in tags (linefeedse)

# 0.6.0 / 0.6.0-alpha
* **BREAKING**: Period/length uses now seconds instead of minutes
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses new syntax to support static
* Support of --debug flag which outputs some dev debug informations
* Support of metrics who are not included in tags api (e.g. autoscaling metrics)

Before
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
      region: eu-west-1
      metrics:
        - name: HealthyHostCount
          statistics:
          - 'Minimum'
          period: 60
          length: 300
```

New Syntax:
```yaml
discovery:
  - region: eu-west-1
    type: elb
    searchTags:
      - Key: KubernetesCluster
        Value: production
    metrics:
      - name: HealthyHostCount
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
static:
  - namespace: AWS/AutoScaling
    region: eu-west-1
    dimensions:
     - name: AutoScalingGroupName
       value: Test
    metrics:
      - name: GroupInServiceInstances
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
```

# 0.5.0
* Support of EFS - Elastic File System
* Support of EBS - Elastic Block Storage

# 0.4.0
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses list as statistics config option,
this should reduce api calls for more than one statistics.

Before:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics: 'Maximum'
```
After:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics:
        - 'Maximum'
```
