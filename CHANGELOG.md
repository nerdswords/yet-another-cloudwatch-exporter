# 0.4.0
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses list as statistics config option,
this should reduce api calls for more than one statistics.

Before:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics: 'Maximum'
```
After:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics:
        - 'Maximum'
```
* Start to track changes in CHANGELOG.md
* Increase speed, not only each jobs threaded but now each metric
* Add s3 support
* Fix potential race condition during cloudwatch access
* Fix bug ignoring period in cloudwatch config
* Use interfaces for aws access and prepare code for unit tests
* Implement minimum, average, maximum, sum for cloudwatch api
* Implement way to handle multiple data returned by cloudwatch
* Update go dependencies
