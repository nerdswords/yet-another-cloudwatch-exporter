# 0.59.0

**Important news and breaking changes**

This release brings a bunch of breaking changes:
* Setting `roundingPeriod` for discovery jobs is deprecated, a warning will be logged at startup. This is being deprecated in favor of always using the metric period. The implementation for `roundingPeriod` can result in inconsistent Start and EndTime between batches. This negates its intent to ensure Start and EndTimes align with the metric period for [CloudWatch best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricData.html). This has the potential to produce data which will look inaccurate when compared against CloudWatch itself driving a lot of confusion. See https://github.com/nerdswords/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/issues/1290 for further context.
* Setting `delay` at the metric level is deprecated, a warning will be logged at startup. This `delay` configuration has existed for a long time but was never utilized. Deprecating it and eventually removing it was chosen to simplify the configuration. See https://github.com/nerdswords/yet-another-cloudwatch-exporter/issues/1290#issuecomment-1948904375 for further context.
* For discovery jobs, the `type` field and the keys of `exportedTagsOnMetrics` must be the AWS namespace rather than the alias (the README contains an up-to-date list of namespaces). Aliases are not allowed anymore. An error will be thrown at startup in an invalid namespace or an alias is used.
* Some metric names have been changed to avoid duplicating the namespace. This includes:
  - `aws_es_esreporting_failed_request_sys_err_count` is `aws_es_reporting_failed_request_sys_err_count`
  - `aws_es_esreporting_failed_request_user_err_count` is `aws_es_reporting_failed_request_user_err_count`
  - `aws_es_esreporting_request_count` is `aws_es_reporting_request_count`
  - `aws_es_esreporting_success_count` is `aws_es_reporting_success_count`
  - `aws_kafka_kafka_app_logs_disk_used` is `aws_kafka_app_logs_disk_used`
  - `aws_kafka_kafka_data_logs_disk_used` is `aws_kafka_data_logs_disk_used`
  - `aws_rds_rdsto_aurora_postgre_sqlreplica_lag` is  `aws_rds_to_aurora_postgre_sqlreplica_lag`
  - `aws_glue_glue_.*` is `aws_glue_.*`

These breaking changes will allow making the configuration easier to understand and less error prone, and also to build better documentation around supported services.

# v0.52.0

**Important news and breaking changes**

This releases introduces the feature flag `aws-sdk-v2` (by @kgeckhart), which changes YACE networking layer to use the AWS sdk v2 package. Read on for more details and considerations.

  * The main benefit of sdk v2 is deserialization/serialization is done via code generation vs reflection which drastically lowers memory/cpu usage for large scrape jobs
  * Considerations before enabling sdk v2:
    1. FIPS is not supported in v2 as v2 delegates all URL resolution to the sdk and AWS does not have FIPS compliant endpoints for AutoScaling API and Tagging API. The v1 implementation worked around this by hard coding FIPS URLs where they existed and using non-FIPS URLs otherwise. This work around was not ported to v2 and is unlikely to be ported.
    2. sdk v2 uses regional sts endpoints by default vs global sts which is [considered legacy by aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/feature-sts-regionalized-endpoints.html). The `sts-region` job configuration is still respected when setting the region for sts and will be used if provided. If you still require global sts instead of regional set the `sts-region` to `aws-global`.

**Bugfixes and features**

* [BREAKING] Fix the calculation of start and end times for GetMetricData (csquire)
```
floating-time-window is now replaced with roundingPeriod

Specifies how the current time is rounded before calculating start/end times for CloudWatch GetMetricData requests. This rounding is optimize performance of the CloudWatch request. This setting only makes sense to use if, for example, you specify a very long period (such as 1 day) but want your times rounded to a shorter time (such as 5 minutes). to For example, a value of 300 will round the current time to the nearest 5 minutes. If not specified, the roundingPeriod defaults to the same value as shortest period in the job.

Thanks a lot to all contributors! - Lovely to see so much efforts especially in testing
to get this project more and more stable. - I know we are far away from a nice tested
code base but we are improving in the right direction and I really love to see all
of your efforts there. It is really appreciated from my side.

I just contacted AWS to get some open source credits so we can build some kind of
end to end tests. This shoud allow us to find tricky bugs earlier and not only when we ship
things.

Love to all of you, Thomas!

# 0.31.0-alpha
* [BREAKING] Decoupled scraping is now default. Removed code which allowed to use scraper without it.
```
# Those flags are just ignored
-decoupled-scraping=false
-decoupled-scraping=true
```
* [BREAKING] Small timeframes of scraping can be used again now. In the past yace decided the scraping
  interval based on config. This magic was removed for simplicity.
```
# In the past this would have in some cases still set --scraping-interval 600
--scraping-interval 10
# Now it really would scrape every 10 seconds which could introduce big API costs. So please watch
# your API requests!
--scraping-interval 10

# 0.16.0-alpha
* Hugh rewrite: Decouple scraping and serving metrics. Thanks so much daviddetorres!
* *BREAKING CHANGE* Decoupled scraping and set scraping interval to 5 minutes.
```
The flag 'decoupled-scraping' makes the exporter to scrape Cloudwatch metrics in background in fixed intervals, in stead of each time that the '/metrics' endpoint is fetched. This protects from the abuse of API requests that can cause extra billing in AWS account. This flag is activated by default.

If the flag 'decoupled-scraping' is activated, the flag 'scraping-interval' defines the seconds between scrapes. Its default value is 300.

```yaml
# Before
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace
      disableTimestamp: true
# After
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace

# Before
  metrics:
    - name: FreeStorageSpace

        roleArn: xxx
        statistics:
        - 'Sum'
        period: 600
        length: 60
```

# 0.9.0
* Add lambda support (nhinds)

# After, now name tags are on metrics and no grouping needed
aws_ec2_cpuutilization_average
```

* **BREAKING** Change config syntax. Now you can define tags which are exported as labels on metrics.
Before:

```yaml
discovery:
  - region: eu-west-1
    type: "es"
    searchTags:
      - Key: type
        Value: ^(easteregg|k8s)$
    metrics:
      - name: FreeStorageSpace
        statistics:
        - 'Sum'
        period: 600
        length: 60
```

New Syntax with optional exportedTagsOnMetrics:
```yaml
discovery:
  exportedTagsOnMetrics:
    ec2:
      - Name
  jobs:
    - region: eu-west-1
      type: "es"
      searchTags:
        - Key: type
          Value: ^(easteregg|k8s)$
      metrics:
        - name: FreeStorageSpace
          statistics:
          - 'Sum'
          period: 600
          length: 60
```

        period: 60
        length: 300
```

# 0.6.1
* Sanitize colons in tags (linefeedse)

# 0.6.0 / 0.6.0-alpha
* **BREAKING**: Period/length uses now seconds instead of minutes
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses new syntax to support static
* Support of --debug flag which outputs some dev debug informations
* Support of metrics who are not included in tags api (e.g. autoscaling metrics)

Before
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
      region: eu-west-1
      metrics:
        - name: HealthyHostCount
          statistics:
          - 'Minimum'
          period: 60
          length: 300
```

New Syntax:
```yaml
discovery:
  - region: eu-west-1
    type: elb
    searchTags:
      - Key: KubernetesCluster
        Value: production
    metrics:
      - name: HealthyHostCount
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
static:
  - namespace: AWS/AutoScaling
    region: eu-west-1
    dimensions:
     - name: AutoScalingGroupName
       value: Test
    metrics:
      - name: GroupInServiceInstances
        statistics:
        - 'Minimum'
        period: 60
        length: 300
```

# 0.5.0
* Support of EFS - Elastic File System
* Support of EBS - Elastic Block Storage

# 0.4.0
* **BREAKING**: Config file uses list as statistics config option,
this should reduce api calls for more than one statistics.

Before:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics: 'Maximum'
```
After:
```yaml
jobs:
  - discovery:
    metrics:
        statistics:
        - 'Maximum'
```
* Start to track changes in CHANGELOG.md
* Better error handling (discordianfish)
* Increase speed, not only each jobs threaded but now each metric
* Add s3 support
* Fix potential race condition during cloudwatch access
* Fix bug ignoring period in cloudwatch config
* Use interfaces for aws access and prepare code for unit tests
* Implement minimum, average, maximum, sum for cloudwatch api
* Implement way to handle multiple data returned by cloudwatch
* Update go dependencies
